*Reminder*
*   *Do not miss [deadline](https://su2.utia.cas.cz/labs.html#projects) for uploading your implementation and documentation of your final project.*
*   *Include working demo in Colab, in which you clearly demonstrate your results. Please refer to the Implementation section on the [labs website](https://su2.utia.cas.cz/labs.html#projects).*
*   *Do not upload huge datasets to GitHub repository.*

Main idea: 
Use machine learning models to mend faulty simulation output to be able to generate artificial experimental data for alpha particle measurements with hybrid semiconductor detector.

Tasks: 
- Retrieve experimental data and faulty simulation data for alpha particle measurement with hybrid semiconductor detector. The alpha source used is Am nuclei, the detector utilized contains Timepix 3 ASIC chip and Si sensor with 500um thickness.
- Prepare experimental and simulation data into the form suitable as an input to machine learning model. This should also involve data cleaning if needed.
- Build GAN to generate artificial experimental data by mending faulty simulation output and by comparing to the experimental data.
